A 3-Dimensional, Third-person adventure created as a project for Game MSCH-C220.

After speaking with the NPC, ghosts will begin spawning and a timer will start. The goal is to reach the "Ghost Gizmo" at the top of the plume of smoke before time runs out. The ghosts cannot harm you, but they can (and will) push you around.
